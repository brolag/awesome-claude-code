# Conventional Branches Commands for Claude Code

Create professional git branches following Conventional Branch v1.0.0 specification with intelligent branch management.

## Command 1: `branch-create` - Create New Conventional Branch

```bash
# COMMIT DETAILS:
$ARGUMENTS

## Process

1. **Analyze Current Repository State**
   - Check current branch with `git branch --show-current`
   - Verify git repository exists
   - Check for uncommitted changes (warn if present)
   - Identify default branch (main/master)
   - Show current branch and status

2. **Intelligent Type Detection & Suggestions**
   Based on common development patterns:
   - Issue numbers ‚Üí suggest `feat` or `fix`
   - Keywords in arguments ‚Üí suggest appropriate type
   - Current branch context ‚Üí suggest logical branch type

3. **Display Branch Type Options**
   ```
   Available branch types:
   ‚ú® feat     - New feature development
   üêõ fix      - Bug fix or hotfix
   üìù docs     - Documentation updates
   üé® style    - Code style/formatting changes

5. **Branch Name Validation**
   - Ensure format: `<type>/<description>` or `<type>/<issue>-<description>`

   - Validate against git branch naming rules
   - Ensure uniqueness

6. **Execute Branch Creation**
   - Create and checkout new branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
   - Display success confirmation with branch info

## Example Branch Names
```
feat/user-authentication
fix/login-validation-error
docs/api-documentation-update
refactor/payment-service

fix/456-checkout-bug
```
```

## Command 2: `branch-switch` - Smart Branch Switching

## Command 3: `branch-list` - Enhanced Branch Listing

```bash
# COMMIT DETAILS:
$ARGUMENTS

## Process

1. **Comprehensive Branch Analysis**
   - List all branches (local and remote)
   - Group by conventional types
   - Show branch relationships and tracking
   - Calculate branch metrics (commits ahead/behind, age)

2. **Enhanced Display Format**
   ```
   üìã CONVENTIONAL BRANCHES
